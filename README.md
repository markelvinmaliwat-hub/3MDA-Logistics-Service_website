# 3MDA Logistics — agent dashboard

Single-file dashboard (`index.html`) published with GitHub Pages. Agents log in, see
their own PLDT / RED sales, and the owner can trigger the daily sales-status emails.

## Files

| File | What it is |
| --- | --- |
| `index.html` | The whole app: markup, styles and logic. Published as-is by GitHub Pages. |
| `AgentNotices.gs` | **Mirror only** of the Google Apps Script file that actually sends the emails. |

## The email code does not live here

Pages is static — it cannot schedule or send anything. The daily 8:00 AM notices run in
the Apps Script project bound to the **DATABASE AUG TO OCT** spreadsheet:

* `sendNotices_` builds one formal English email per agent (FOR PAYMENT + RETURNED SALES).
* RETURNED = rows in the `VALIDATORS` tab **plus** `PLDT` / `RED` rows whose `FINAL STATUS`
  starts with `RTS` / `RETURN`, deduped so a sale is never listed twice.
* The daily trigger runs `runAgentNotices` against **Head** — the latest saved code.
* The web app serves the **published version** only. After editing, run
  **Deploy > Manage deployments > New version**, or the dashboard keeps calling old code.

Editing `AgentNotices.gs` in this repo changes nothing until it is pasted into Apps
Script and saved. Keep the two copies in step by pasting from this file.

## Settings that matter

In `AgentNotices.gs`: `DRY_RUN` (true = every notice goes to `ADMIN_EMAILS` labelled
`[TEST for <agent>]`), `SEND_HOUR`, `MAX_ROWS` per section, `SHEET_ID`, `ADMIN_EMAILS`.

In `index.html`: `WEB_APP_URL` (sales data + activity log), `NOTICE_APP_URL` (the notices
web app), `MAIL_ADMINS` (who may see the **Email agents** button).

## Manual send token

Anyone who reads the page source can see `NOTICE_APP_URL`, so the send action is gated by
a token kept in **Script Properties** (`NOTICE_SEND_TOKEN`) — never in this repo. Run
`setNoticeSendToken('your secret')` once in Apps Script; the dashboard then asks for that
token before **Send emails now**. `setNoticeSendToken('')` removes the requirement.
